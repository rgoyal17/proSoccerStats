        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p>
            In my web app, I plan to design an effective way to search for soccer players and
            view information and statistics about them. Soccer is a team sport played with a
            spherical ball between two teams of eleven players with the objective to score by
            moving the ball beyond the goal line into the opposing goal. It is played in over
            200 countries, making it the world's most popular sport but I feel not a lot of
            people follow it here in the US. I hope to maybe spread some awareness about
            this amazing game by providing useful information through my app. I am really
            passionate about soccer and feel like there exists no user-friendly app for soccer
            fans to look up their favorite players to get some information about them other
            than googling each player. This app will enable users to easily get all of the
            information about any professional soccer player in one place.
        </p>
        <p>
            The most popular online source for getting information about soccer is currently
            through this website by <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/">ESPN</a>. Although
            this is a very informative site, I feel that it is trying to give too much
            information at once such as news, fixtures, scores, etc. and does not focus on
            specific player stats. It is the same for other sources like
            <a href="https://www.whoscored.com/Statistics">WhoScored</a>. There is no web app
            particularly for just player information and statistics, most focus on teams.

        <h2>App Description</h2>
        <p>
            I plan to make a web app for soccer fans and people hoping to find data about
            their favoite soccer players. It can be used to look up professional soccer
            players and view information and statistics about them such as teams played
            for, number of goals scored, matches played, fouls committed, etc. Search
            results can be filtered based on attributes like country, league, team, etc.
            Based on statistics, you can compare players. A user can also choose its
            favorite players and make their own teams. There will also be a login option
            so that users' favorite players and teams are saved. The player data is gathered
            from <a href="https://rapidapi.com/api-sports/api/api-football">this</a> API
            source and the stats are updated frequently.
        </p>
        <p>
            Rather than trying to provide too much information about soccer like fixtures,
            teams, scores, etc., my app will only focus on player information and
            statistics. In this way, my app will be user-friendly and not too complicated.
            By providing all this information in one place, and making it easy to access,
            my app will be helpful in spreading awareness and gaining more knowledge about
            this game.
