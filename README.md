# ProSoccerStats

This repository contains code for an interactive web app, started as an assignment for the _Client-Side Web Development_ course at the UW iSchool, later developed further as a personal project.

- This web app which enables a user to search any professional soccer player and view information and statistics (number of goals, assists, matches/minutes played, tackles, etc.) about that player, compare up to 4 players, and make a list of favorite players (requires sign in).
- Built entirely using the ReactJS framework (utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and data gathered from an API and
datasets from Kaggle. Incorporated concepts/tools like ES6, bootstrap, react-router, responsive CSS, etc.
- Used Google Firebase for hosting application, data storage, and user authentication

The app can be viewed at <https://pro-soccer-stats.firebaseapp.com/>
